            <h2>Track 3</h2>

            <h3>You Are What You Eat</h3>

            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Food is often considered a manifestation of our identities and culture. Unfortunately, our identities are often equated with our cultural products. How does food fit into the continuing narrative of dominant culture appropriating our products and "elevating" them? How and why do others profit off our culture, and how can we combat this prevailing trend?</p>
