            <h2>Track 3</h2>

            <h3>Media Portrayal of Asians in the U.S.</h3>

            <p><strong>Description:</strong> Media and film shape the way we perceive our world and our communities, but throughout the film industry, there has been a lack of response to promoting Asian actors in leading roles. Whitewashing has been a prevalent issue over the years, although the number of Asian actors have increased. Most notably, recent films such as "Ghost in the Shell" (2017), and Aloha (2015) exhibited whitewashing since their main character of Asian descent were played by Caucasian actresses. Aside from whitewashing, western media has consistently reinforced many Asian stereotypes such as the inability to speak English or drive safely.
