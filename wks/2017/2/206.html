            <h3>NYC Take Back Our Education</h3>

            <p><strong>Description:</strong> The election of Betsy DeVos as Sec. Ed serves as a symptom and as evidence of a worsening educational climate for students: the proposals of bills in which publicly funded schools are becoming highly privatized, culturally relevant curriculum and ethnic studies are being attacked, and a continuing policing and militarization of the schools. In this workshop, we will develop a strong analysis of the worsening education crisis of the U.S. with a specific focus on the Filipino youth and student community  and more importantly, how we can address this crisis and fight to #TakeBackOurEducation!</p>
