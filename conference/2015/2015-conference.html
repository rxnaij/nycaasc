        <h3>Critical Mass</h3>
        <p>2014 was not a landmark year in America’s long history of human rights violations, but it was significant in the refusal of bodies to stand back in the face of injustice. “BLACK LIVES MATTER!” was yelled into the night air, as the list of murdered names grew every day, connected by their perceived social identities of race, gender, sex, sexuality— ultimately, in difference: a difference marked on the body and fraught with meaning.</p>

The piece, titled “We Will Not Be Moved”, was an ode to their heritage - a mix of refugee war stories and ruminations about skin color and stereotypes. Their mix of refreshingly honest rhymes and organic beats has since become the duo’s trademark as they went on to rock stages and move hearts at hundreds of venues across the nation. Direct, the mastermind behind their instrumentals, draws upon his classical roots to create beats heavy on melody and acoustic stylings. He tops off his production with insightful lyrics and a uniquely versatile flow that make his vocals as much an instrument as a message. And then there is T-Vu, a female emcee with no need for the “female” qualifier. A wordsmith of rare caliber and presence - she’s known for her precise delivery and no-nonsense rhymes.</div>
